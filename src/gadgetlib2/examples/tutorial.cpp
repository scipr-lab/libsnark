/*
    This test gives the first example of a construction of a constraint system. We use the terms
    'Constraint System' and 'Circuit' interchangeably rather loosly. It is easy to
    visualize a circuit with inputs and outputs. Each gate imposes some logic on the inputs and
    output wires. For instance, AND(inp1, inp2) will impose the 'constraint' (inp1 & inp2 = out)
    Thus, we can also think of this circuit as a system of constraints. Each gate is a mathematical
    constraint and each wire is a variable. In the AND example over a boolean field {0,1} we would
    write the constraint as (inp1 * inp2 == out). This constraint is 'satisfied' relative to an
    assignment if we assign values to {inp1, inp2, out} such that the constraint evaluates to TRUE.
    All following examples will be either field agnostic or of a specific form of prime fields:
    (1) Field agnostic case: In these examples we create high level circuits by using lower level
        circuits. This way we can ignore the specifics of a field and assume the lower level takes
        care of this. If we must explicitly write constraints in these circuits, they will always
        be very basic constraints which are defined over every field (e.g. x + y = 0).
    (2) All field specific examples in this library are for a prime characteristic field with the
        special form of 'quadratic rank 1 polynomials', or R1P. This is the only form used with the
        current implementaition of SNARKs. The form for these constraints is
        (Linear Combination) * (Linear Combination) == (Linear Combination).
        The library has been designed to allow future addition of other characteristics/forms in
        the future by implementing only low level circuits for these forms.
*/
TEST(Examples, ProtoboardUsage) {
    // Initialize prime field parameters. This is always needed for R1P.
    initPublicParamsFromDefaultPp();
    // The protoboard is the 'memory manager' which holds all constraints (when creating the
    // verifying circuit) and variable assignments (when creating the proof witness). We specify
    // the type as R1P, this can be augmented in the future to allow for BOOLEAN or GF2_EXTENSION
    // fields in the future.
    ProtoboardPtr pb = Protoboard::create(R1P);
    // We now create 3 input variables and one output
    VariableArray input(3, "input");
    Variable output("output");
    // We can now add some constraints. The string is for debuging purposes and can be a textual
    // description of the constraint
    pb->addRank1Constraint(input[0], 5 + input[2], output,
                           "Constraint 1: input[0] * (5 + input[2]) == output");
    // The second form addUnaryConstraint(LinearCombination) means (LinearCombination == 0).
    pb->addUnaryConstraint(input[1] - output,
                           "Constraint 2: input[1] - output == 0");
    // Notice this could also have been written:
    // pb->addRank1Constraint(1, input[1] - input[2], 0, "");
    //
    // For fields with more general forms, once implemented, we could use
    // addGeneralConstraint(Polynomial1, Polynomial2, string) which translates to the constraint
    // (Polynomial1 == Polynomial2).  Example:
    // pb->addGeneralConstraint(input[0] * (3 + input[1]) * input[2], output + 5,
    //                          "input[0] * (3 + input[1]) * input[2] == output + 5");
    //
    // Now we can assign values to the variables and see if the constraints are satisfied.
    // Later, when we will run a SNARK (or any other proof system), the constraints will be
    // used by the verifier, and the assigned values will be used by the prover.
    // Notice the protoboard stores the assignment values.
    pb->val(input[0]) = pb->val(input[1]) = pb->val(input[2]) = pb->val(output) = 42;
    EXPECT_FALSE(pb->isSatisfied());
    // The constraint system is not satisfied. Now lets try values which satisfy the two equations
    // above:
    pb->val(input[0]) = 1;
    pb->val(input[1]) = pb->val(output) = 42; // input[1] - output == 0
    pb->val(input[2]) = 37; // 1 * (5 + 37) == 42
    EXPECT_TRUE(pb->isSatisfied());
}

/*
    In the above example we explicitly wrote all constraints and assignments.

    In this example we will construct a very simple gadget, one that implements a NAND gate. This
    gadget is field-agnostic as it only uses lower level gadgets and the field elments '0' and '1'.

    Gadgets are the framework which allow us to delegate construction of sophisticated circuitry
    to lower levels. Each gadget can construct a constraint system or a witness or both, by
    defining constraints and assignments as well as by utilizing sub-gadgets.

/*
    Another example showing the use of DualVariable. A DualVariable is a variable which holds both
    a bitwise representation of a word and a packed representation (e.g. both the packed value {42}
    and the unpacked value {1,0,1,0,1,0}). If the word is short enough
    (for example any integer smaller than the prime characteristic) then the packed representation
    will be stored in 1 field element. 'word' in this context means a set of bits, it is a
    convention which means we expect some semantic ability to decompose the packed value into its
    bits.
    The use of DualVariables is for efficiency reasons. More on this at the end of this example.
    In this example we will construct a gadget which receives as input a packed integer value
    called 'hash', and a 'difficulty' level in bits, and constructs a circuit validating that the
    first 'difficulty' bits of 'hash' are '0'. For simplicity we will assume 'hash' is always 64
    bits long.

/*
    In this exampe we will construct a gadget which builds a circuit for proof (witness) and
    validation (constraints) that a bitcoin transaction's sum of inputs equals the the sum of
    outputs + miners fee. Construction of the proof will include finding the miners'
    fee. This fee can be thought of as an output of the circuit.

    This is a field specific gadget, as we will use the '+' operator freely. The addition
    operation works as expected over integers while in prime characteristic fields but not so in
    extension fields. If you are not familiar with extension fields, don't worry about it. Simply
    be aware that + and * behave differently in different fields and don't necessarily give the
    integer values you would expect.

    The library design supports multiple field constructs due to different applied use cases. Some
    cryptogragraphic applications may need extension fields while others may need prime fields
    but with constraints which are not rank-1 and yet others may need boolean circuits. The library
    was designed so that high level gadgets can be reused by implementing only the low level for
    a new field or constraint structure.

    Later we will supply a recipe for creation of such field specfic gadgets with agnostic
    interfaces. We use a few conventions here in order to ease the process by using macros.
