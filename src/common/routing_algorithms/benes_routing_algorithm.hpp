 Declaration of interfaces for functionality for routing on a Benes network.

 Routing is performed via the standard algorithm that computes a
 routing by first computing the switch settings for the left and right
 columns of the network and then recursively computing routings for
 the top half and the bottom half of the network (each of which is a
 Benes network of smaller size).
