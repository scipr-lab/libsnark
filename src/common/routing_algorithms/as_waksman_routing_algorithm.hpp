 Declaration of interfaces for functionality for routing on an arbitrary-size (AS) Waksman network.

 AS-Waksman networks were introduced in \[BD02]. An AS-Waksman network for
 N packets is recursively defined as follows: place a column of floor(N/2) switches on
 the left, and a column of floor(N/2) switches on the right; then place two AS-Waksman
 sub-networks, for floor(N/2) and ceil(N/2) packets respectively, in the middle.

 Note that unlike for Bene≈° networks where each switch handles routing
 of one packet to one of its two possible destinations, AS-Waksman
 network employs switches with two input ports and two output ports
 and operate either in "straight" or "cross mode".

 Routing is performed in a way that is similar to routing on Benes networks:
 one first computes the switch settings for the left and right columns,
 and then one recursively computes routings for the top and bottom sub-networks.
 More precisely, as in \[BD02], we treat the problem of determining the switch
 settings of the left and right columns as a 2-coloring problem on a certain
 bipartite graph. The coloring is found by performing a depth-first search on
 the graph and alternating the color at every step. For performance reasons
 the graph in our implementation is implicitly represented.
